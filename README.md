Plotting data on belly button biodiversity for the web

For this homework assignment, I had to read data from [samples.json](samples.json) and develop a dashboard for disaplying charts related to the different IDs in the data.

Webpage deployed to [https://improvbutterfly.github.io/bellybutton-biodiversity/](https://improvbutterfly.github.io/bellybutton-biodiversity/)

## How It Works

I used Plotly to graph the charts, and D3 to display the dropbown menu using the supplied data.

The webpage initially loads using the first ID in the supplied data. All of the charts and demographics metadata are updated on change of selection from the dropdown menu.

Charts:
* Top ten OTUs horizontal bar chart
* Bubble chart with all the data
* Gauge chart indicating frequency of bellybutton washing.
